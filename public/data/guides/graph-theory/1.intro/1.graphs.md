# An Introduction to Graphs

## Graphs and Computer Science

In the context of computer science, a **graph** is a way of representing objects, and the relationships between those objects.

Graphs appear in a wide variety of places in computer science. Take the internet, for example. Say you have a website called Website A. That website has links to two other websites, Websites B and C. Also, Website C has a link to Website B. Even with just three websites, there's already a lot of relationships to consider! We can model those relationships using a graph, like the one below:

    alt="Graph of Web Pages"
/>

This graph uses **vertices** (also called points or nodes), to represent the three websites: A, B, and C. It also uses **edges** (also called lines) to connect vertices together. In this case, the edges follow a rule: there's an edge pointing from one vertex to another if and only if there's a link from the corresponding former webpage to the corresponding latter webpage.

By looking at this graph, we can begin to answer questions about the relationships between these webpages more easily: Is it possible to get from Webpage B to Webpage C? If I start at Webpage A, how many different ways are there to end up at Webpage B?

Of course, these questions were probably simple enough to get an answer for even without drawing the graph. But the real power of graphs comes when we consider how a computer might use them: a computer can process graphs with orders of magnitude more vertices and edges than people possibly can. And if we give computers the right algorithms--algorithms to search a graph, find paths through a graph, and more--then computers can use graphs to achieve powerful results.

Graphs appear in many places in the domain of computer science, far beyond just the web page example shown above. Understanding graphs, their properties, and the algorithms to analyze them will enable you to solve a whole host of problems.
