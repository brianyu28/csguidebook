# What is `git`?

While working on writing code for a project, there are a number of problems you might run into. For one, you might find that you need to keep track of a lot of different versions of your code-- as you make changes, you might want to keep track of the changes you've made in case you ever need to refer to them. And if you make a mistake while writing code, you'll likely want to be able to quickly revert back to an older, working version of the codebase.

In addition, if you have a working codebase, you might want to be able to try working on a new feature without fear of breaking the original. And if you're collaborating with other people on the same codebase, and multiple people are editing the same codebase at the same time, you'll want some way to combine all your changes together, and to stay up to date with everyone's latest work.

`git` is a piece of **version control software** designed to solve all of these problems. In this guide, we'll look at the features of `git` and how to use them. By the end, you'll be able to

* Create a `git` repository
* Create commits in that repository to keep track of changes to code
* Create and manage branches in your repository to work on different changes simultaneously
* Push your code to an online repository, like GitHub, to collaborate with others
* And more!
