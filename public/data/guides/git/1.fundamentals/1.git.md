# What is `git`?

While writing code for a project, there are a number of problems you might encounter. For one, you’ll likely want to keep track of  changes you make to your code in case you need to refer back to them. And if you make a mistake, you'll want to quickly revert back to an older, working version of the project.

The problems get more complicated if you’re working with other people over an extended period of time. If you have a working codebase, you’ll want to be able to work on a new feature without fear of breaking the original, working code. And if you're collaborating with other people on the same code, and multiple people are editing files at the same time, you'll want some way to combine all your changes together.

`git` is a piece of **version control software** designed to solve all of these problems. In this guide, we'll look at the features of `git` and how to use them. By the end, you'll be able to

* Create a `git` repository
* Create commits in that repository to keep track of changes to code
* Create and manage branches in your repository
* Leverage more advanced `git` techniques and workflows to make your work more efficient
* Push your code to an online repository, like GitHub, to collaborate with others
* And more!

## Some Basic Ideas

Before diving into how to actually use `git`, it's useful to gain an intuition for how to think about `git` and its uses.

For starters, `git` can be used to keep track of changes you make to your code. As you modify files, `git` lets you take a snapshot of all of your files at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a **commit**. Once you've made commits, `git` lets you look back at them, to see the history of your project over time.

Of course, the above diagram assumes that all your changes are linear: one after another, each one building upon the previous. In reality, you might be working on different features at once, or different people might be working on the same project simultaneously. That's why `git` has a feature called **branches**. For now, you can think of branches like different versions of your project.

Imagine starting a project, and making a few changes:

    guide="git"
    filename="1.1.branches0.svg"
    alt="You might begin with a series of commits"
/>

At this point, you have a working version of your project, but you want to try adding a new feature. As you work on adding this new feature, though, you don't want to disrupt all of the progress you've made in your existing code. So rather than add new commits to the same branch you were on previously, you can create a new branch, and add your new feature there.

<Image
    guide="git"
    filename="1.1.branches1.svg"
    alt="You can add a branch to work on a new feature"
/>

The advantage now is that you have two different branches: two versions of your code, one with your original working code, and one with your new feature. If you need to make an update to the original code while you're still working on the new feature, no problem: just go back to the original branch and add the commit there.

    filename="1.1.branches2.svg"
    alt="You can keep working on the original branch"
/>

Then, once you've tested the new feature and feel comfortable with it, `git` allows you to **merge** one branch into another, allowing you to bring all of your new features back onto the original branch.
