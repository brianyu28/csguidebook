# `git` Repositories

## What is a repository?

In `git` parlance, a **repository** is just a fancy word for a project that's tracked by `git`. Your repository contains all of the files in your project, but also the information that `git` stores to keep track of your commit history (the changes you've made to the project) and your various branches, among other things.

## Creating a Repository

Perhaps the best way to get comfortable with the ideas behind `git` is to create a repository and begin experimenting with it. In order to start using `git`, you'll need to install it on your computer first if it's not already installed. If you need to install `git`, you can download it from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you've installed `git` on your computer, you can create a repository. First, create a new directory to use as a `git` repository by running this command on the command line:

```
$ mkdir project
```

`mkdir` is a command that creates a new directory (or folder), and `project` can be whatever name you want to give to your project. Then, move into your project by running:

```
$ cd project
```

Now, you can create your repository. Run:

```
$ git init
```

You should get a message from `git` indicating that it has `Initialized empty Git repository`. What this means is that `git` is now treating your project directory as a `git` repository that it will now track.
